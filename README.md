# BlogList Frontend 
This is the frontend of a fullstack application that let's you login (if you created a user) and save blogs that may interest you. 
It was build with React, and uses axios library for making the HTTP requests to the server.

## To make it work:
Fork the repo and install dependencies. After that run command `npm run dev`, then letter `o` to open in browser. Note that you wont be able to login to app or see anything without the setup of the server in the backend code. Instructions there --> [BACKEND REPO](https://github.com/pipiolus/blogList-backend)
